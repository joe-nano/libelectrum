libwallet is a client side library for wallet functionality such as
working with addresses, deterministic wallets and different key formats.
libwallet was originally created after forking the non-critical code
from libbitcoin into a separate library. As server-only dependencies
are being removed from libbitcoin this will soon be merged back into
libbitcoin.
